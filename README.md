# AmazonUK-To-Euro
This extension converts most &pound; prices on amazon.co.uk to &euro;s. It does not account for differences in VAT
so the conversion may be a little off. You can click on the extension's icon and add a bias to the exchange rate
to artificially make the pound stronger to help with this. 

## Installing

You can get the extension through the [chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amazon-uk-to-euro/bakojiafihbgfbdgimbfaiieadildbaf)
